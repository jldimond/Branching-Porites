    Reference sequence must be uncompressed fasta or bgzip compressed,
    your file is probably gzip compressed. The simplest fix is to gunzip
    your reference sequence by running this command:

        gunzip /Volumes/toaster/jdimond/Branching-Porites/data/Sym_genome/GCA_001939145.1_ASM193914v1_genomic.fna.gz

    Then edit your params file to remove the `.gz` from the end of the
    path to your reference sequence file and rerun step 3 with the `-f` flag.
